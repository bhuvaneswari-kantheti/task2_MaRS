# task2_MaRS

                                                  TASK_2 MaRS 

 

Aim: 

Send the data of a string message using an RF Transmitter module which can be received by a RF receiver module. 

Components: 

RF transmitter module 

RF receiver module 

Arduino Uno 

Jumper wires 


Procedure: 

Install Arduino IDE to upload the code into the Arduino Uno. 

Arrange connections between the RF transmitter and the Arduino properly using jumper wires. 

  Connections are given below: 

 	 1.Vcc: Connect this to a regulated 5 Volt power supply. 

   2.Data: This is the data input pin. It receives the signal to be transmitted. It is connected to pin 12.

   3.Ground: Connect this to the ground. 

Connect the Arduino board to the laptop. 

Install the Radiohead library and write the code in Arduino IDE. 

Upload the code to Arduino. 

Similarly set up the RF receiver also. 

  

Testing: 

Power on both Arduino's and the transmitter sends a string message. The receiver receives the message.

Thought Process:  

I have never done any projects related to electronics before, and this was really interesting to work on. This is my first hands-on experience with electronics. I 
have learned how the transmission and reception work between two Arduino's by working on this simple project. I have sent a string message through this RF 
transmitter, and it was received by a RF receiver. I have included a Radiohead library in the code, and I have learned about different functions used in this 
code. Overall, it was a very good experience for me.
