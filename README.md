# task2_MaRS

Aim : Send the data of a string message using an RF Transreceiver module which can be received by a RF receiver module.

Components :

RF transmitter module
RF receiver module
Arduino Uno
Jumper wires

Procedure :

Install Aruino IDE to upload the code into the Arduino Uno.
Arrange connections between the RF transmitter and the arduino properly using jumper wires.
  Connections are given below:
  1.Vcc: Connect this to a regulated 5V power supply.
  2.Data (Din): This is the data input pin. It receives the signal to be transmitted.
  3.Ground (GND): Connect this to the ground.
Connect the arduino board to the laptop.
Install the RadioHead library and write the code in Arduino IDE.
Upload the code to the arduino.
Similarly arrange for the RF receiver also.

Testing :
Power on both arduinos and the transmitter send a string message. The receiver receives the message.
